# Important Notice
Please be aware that I'm no longer actively maintaining this plugin.

I believe the problem it solved is now better handled with PWA technologies like Service Worker and Push Notifications.

I would also consider technologies such as Phonegap & Cordova to largely to have been eclipsed by PWAs.

Please keep the above in mind before actively using this plugin.


# Background Service Plugin Sample (bgs-sample)

## Quick summary
This repository provides a sample background service built on the core functionality for the Background Service Plugin for Cordova (bgs-core).  This repository is intended as a learning tool for those developers planning to use the bgs-core to create their own background service.

The bgs-core is provided in the https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core repository.

## Getting started
To understand how to create your own background service it is advised that you read the following articles:

* [Using the MyService Sample] (https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/wiki/Using-the-MyService-Sample)
* [Build your own Background Service] (https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/wiki/Build-your-own-Background-Service)
* [Build your own plugin] (https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/wiki/Build-your-own-plugin)

Further documentation can be found at https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/wiki

## Questions and Support
If you have problems, then please log an issue against the bgs-core repository (https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/issues).

As the plugin is updated (for new features or fixes) I will tweet via @FolderRed and blog http://red-folder.blogspot.co.uk/

## Older version
This version of the plugin is intended to work with Cordova 3.0.0+

The older version of the plugin is available at https://github.com/Red-Folder/Cordova-Plugin-BackgroundService.  Please note however that this older repository is unlikely to be maintained going forwards.  It is advised that you move to Cordova 3.x.x as soon as possible.

## Spread the love

If you find the Background Service Plugin useful then spread the love.

All the work I do on the Plugin is done in my spare time - time I would otherwise be spending taking my wife out for a nice meal or helping my lad find vinyl records (he's currently very much into The Smiths, Fleetwood Mac and Kate Bush).

The Plugin is free and will always remain free. I will continue to develop, maintain and distribute the Plugin under the Apache License.
